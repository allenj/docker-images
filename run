# HI Andy,
#
# It looks like last nights run crashed on the first PRMS run. It was
# looking for the wrong restart file:
#
#   ERROR opening input file: /nhm/NHM-PRMS_CONUS/restart/2019-08-21.restart
#   check to be sure the input file exists file specified by control
#   parameter: var_init_file
#
# should have found 2019-08-20.restart
#
# Also Markstrom, Steven L should pipe in on this one but I think it
# would have failed on the second PRMS run as well:
#
#   Control variable start_time set to 2019,08,20,0,0,0.
#
#   Control variable end_time set to 2020,02,28,0,0,0.
#
#   Control variable init_vars_from_file set to 1.
#
#   Control variable var_init_file set to
#   /nhm/NHM-PRMS_CONUS/restart/2019-08-20.restart.
#
#   Control variable save_vars_to_file set to 0.
#
# Here everything looks correct (it has the correct restart file)
# except that for the last mesage should read save_vars_to_file set to
# 1. Is that right Steve? That saves the new restart file?
#
# [9:04 AM] Markstrom, Steven L
#
# Every day there should be two runs of PRMS. The first one uses the
# restart file that was created on the previous day's run. This run
# does not create a restart file, rather it run for 60 days and it
# creates the output (ie the csv files that subsequently get generated
# into the netcdf files that go to the viz team). After all of that
# happens, there is another run of PRMS that it's only purpose is to
# create a restart file. This run is for normally one day, but would
# be longer if there were more days to catch up from the data
# pull. This run does not create any csv output, but just the restart
# file. This restart file should be dated (ie named) according to the
# day before of the first run that will be made on the next day.
#
# The first run should have "init_vars_from_file" set to "1", and
# var_init_file set to the name of the restart file that was created by
# the second run on the day before.
#
# The first run should also have "save_vars_to_file" set to 0.
#
# The second run should have "init_vars_from_file" and "var_init_file"
# set to the same as the first run (because it needs to be initialized
# the same way), but it should also have "save_vars_to_file" set to
# 1. In addition, it should have "var_save_file" set to
# XXXX-XX-XX.restart, where XXXX-XX-XX is the last date that was run
# in the second run.
#
# The idea is that this restart file, created by the second run on the
# previous day, is one day before the first run that needs to be made
# today.
#
# When "init_vars_from_file" is set to 1, then "var_init_file" needs
# to be specified with the name of a file to use for the restart. And
# a file is created as specified by the name set by the
# "var_init_file" argument. If "init_vars_from_file" is set to 0, then
# it doesn't matter what "var_init_file" is set to, or if it is set,
# because it is not used and no file will be created.
#
# When "save_vars_to_file" is set to 1, then the file specified by
# "var_save_file" must exist because it will be read and used to
# initialize the run. This is the restart file that should have been
# created from the second run on the day before.
